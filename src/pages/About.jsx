                    <br/>
                    From Chicago grew a diverse business professional who revels in potential, a
                    love for the pursuit of excellence and an inspiration towards art and cultural
                    initiatives. I am Demetrius Williamson - marketing professional, writer, avid
                    traveler
                    <span className="roboto "> & </span>
                    progressive thinker; one-time professional athlete.<br/><br/>
                    <ul className="indent">
                        <li className="quote-border">A creative mind with a strong history of achieving
                            outstanding levels in business development, increasing customer/consumer
                            engagement, nurturing cultural core values; while retaining the ability to take
                            risks.</li>

                <p className="about-body">
                    <br/>At glance, my sophistication and personality are favorable for a culturally
                        driven environment. Excellence began with an athletic foundation. I am the
                        grandson of Albert Williamson, a former professional Negro League Baseball
                        player. I traveled the world young playing organized basketball from the
                        Netherlands to Australia. Playing out my college career at NCAA Division I
                        institutions, University of Missouri and Niagara University. Finishing a
                        professional stint in China.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Beyond the basketball court, my background is Marketing, emphasizing strategy,
                    branding and storytelling. Pushing the culture and telling the most inspiring
                    stories. I worked for nearly a decade at Union Pacific, a Fortune 500 company.
                    My last position there was Senior Network Marketing Manager. Iâ€™ve also
                    collaborated for 5+ years with Jordan Brand on various marketing strategies and
                    treatments.<br/><br/>
                    After a timed departure from Union Pacific, I began consulting, writing and
                    storytelling under my own entity. As a marketing liaison, Research Class was
                    created to inspire innovative business growth while building personable
                    marketing strategies.<br/><br/>
                    My native understanding of business is truly from obsessing the work,
                    researching and crafting what pushes the needle and explode boundaries. My
                    prowess has a range from professional athlete to exceptional performance in
                    business development, relationship building
                    <span className="roboto "> & </span>
                    brand marketing.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Business and athletics remain a cornerstone of my foundation. Though, my passion
                    expands through fashion, photography, music and art.<br/>
